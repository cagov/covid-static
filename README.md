# covid-static

This handles the binary files for the covid19.ca.gov site. Files placed in this repository will be deployed to Azure blob storage backed CDN with a low cache timer on files with .pdf extension. This will allow content authors to get new or modified pdfs to production quickly.

We pointed a friendly subdomain at this new CDN: https://files.covid19.ca.gov/ so file paths in this directory are browseable there. 

There is a redirect in place on the covid19.ca.gov server so that /pdf/ requests will get redirected to the new domain files.covid19.ca.gov from the new CDN. We should still update urls to use the new domain directly when we encounter them.

## Uploading files

### Creating subdirectories

- Entire folders can be dragged into the github browser based file manager and github will create the files inside the subdirectory sent

- You can type directory names into the filename field and when you type a / at the end it will add them to the path and give you another field to name the file itself

## File naming

### Dynamically linking translated files

We often have English and translated versions of images or pdfs that are used in the WordPress posts. We send these to AvantPage for human translation and they only translate the visible HTML, leaving the urls the same. In order to get the translated file to dynamically appear when it exists use the following file naming convention:

Your filename should end with: ```--en.pdf``` or ```--en.png```

If you name a file like that when the site is built (which happens anytime content is updated) the page build code creating any non english page will look for a corresponding file location on files.covid19.ca.gov like ```--es.pdf```. If that file is found the appropriate translated file version will be used. If not found the English url will remain.

So if you have a file named: ```myfile--en.pdf``` and you upload it in the pdf directory with another file named ```myfile--ar.pdf``` when the Arabic page containing that url is built the Arabic url will be used.

## Builds

git action builds deploy on any file change, you can rerun an existing manually and it will checkout latest code or you can modify a file to trigger a build
